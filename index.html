<p>A father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling amongthemselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations,he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils ofdisunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him abundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into thehands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it inpieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it.
He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, andagain put them into his sons’ hands, upon which they broke them easily.
He then addressed them in these words: “My sons, if you are of one mind,and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjuredby all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided amongyourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.”</p>

<h3>The Kingdom of the Lion</h3>

<div class="text-content">

<p>The beats of the field and forest had a Lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king
could be. During his reign he made a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the
Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The Hare said, “Oh, how I have longed to see
this day, in which the weak shall take their place with impunity by the side of the strong.” And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.</p>

<h4>The Fisherman Piping</h4>

<p>A fisherman skilled in music took his flute and his nets to the seashore. Standing on a projecting rock, he played several tunes in the hope that the fish, attracted by his melody, would of their own accord
dance into his net, which he had placed below. At last, having long waited in vain, he laid aside his flute, and casting his net into the sea, made an excellent haul of fish. When he saw them leaping about in
the net upon the rock he said: “O you most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.</p>
